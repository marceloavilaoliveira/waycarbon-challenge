# WayCarbon Challenge - DevOps #

This repository contains a solution for a DevOps challenge proposed by the [WayCarbon](https://waycarbon.com/) company.

## The Challenge ##

The full description of the challenge can be find [here](doc/waycarbon-challenge.pdf).

In summary, the challenge is to provision a cloud environment for a web application that consists of a frontend component and a backend component, using one or more Docker containers. The components should be served on the same domain but with different paths. The frontend and backend need to form a cohesive application, with one depending on the other.

## The Project ##

This project is based on [knaopel/docker-frontend-backend-db](https://github.com/knaopel/docker-frontend-backend-db) repository, and consists of 4 services deployed in Docker containers. There is a web app (frontend) that communicates with an API (backend), which in turn reads/writes data to a database (mongo). These services are accessed through a web server (nginx).

The project structure can be better visualized [here](doc/project-structure.jpg).

The final result of the project can be seen running at http://waycarbon-challenge.duckdns.org/.
