# WayCarbon Challenge - DevOps #

This repository contains a solution for a DevOps challenge proposed by the [WayCarbon](https://waycarbon.com/) company.

## The Challenge ##

The full description of the challenge can be find [here](doc/waycarbon-challenge.pdf).

In summary, the challenge is to provision a cloud environment for a web application that consists of a frontend component and a backend component, using one or more Docker containers. The components should be served on the same domain but with different paths. The frontend and backend need to form a cohesive application, with one depending on the other.
